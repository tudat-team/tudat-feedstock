build:
    # A non-negative integer representing the build number of the package.
    #  Unlike the build string, the build_number is inspected by conda.
    #  Conda uses it to sort packages that have otherwise identical names
    #  and versions to determine the latest one. This is important because
    #  new builds that contain bug fixes for the way a package is built may be
    #  added to a repository.

requirements:
  build:
    # Tools required to build the package. These packages are run on the build
    # system and include things such as revision control systems (Git, SVN) make
    # tools (GNU make, Autotool, CMake) and compilers (real cross, pseudo-cross,
    # or native when not cross-compiling), and any source pre-processors.
